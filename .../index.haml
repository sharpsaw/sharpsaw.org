%pre
  Code: TODO

%h2 Checkpoint 2 - Buddy Mode

If you want get more dense you can use to repository here's an example using mine and my friends repositories

%h2 Checkpoint 3 - Private Repos

%pre
  Code: TODO

%pre
  ssh otherhost git init --bare
  \# TODO

%h2 Checkpoint 4 - Sharpsaw Setup

Full on social configuration

Key ideas include
%ul
  %li organizing repos according to reasonable boundaries.
  %li aggressive and conservative configuration, mixed and matched
  %li concensus and exploration
  %li Constant improvement


%h2 TODO

%ul
  %li Mention ...@
  %li Mention ...each
