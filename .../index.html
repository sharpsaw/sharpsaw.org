Do you you have a "github.com/[you]/config" repo?
<ul>
  <li>If not: let me sell you on the idea.</li>
  <li>If so: read on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
At SocialText, we had a common set of dotfiles and scripts that helped make
pair programming more consistent. Instead of the usual friction while pairing,
where the host of the session had all the configs/scripts tuned how they want
and the guest being only able to wish the same was true for them, we converged
on a set of "pairsonalizations" that worked for the whole group.
Ingy d√∂t Net generalized the idea and made
<a href='https://gitub.com/ingydotnet/...'>... (DotDotDot)</a>
There are several levels you can opt-in, and each one is pretty simple:
<h2>Checkpoint 1 - Personal Config Symlinker</h2>
If you do the "config" repo thing, probably have an ad-hoc script to symlink
those files into your home dir, and maybe a script to pull or commit/push those
configs. At its essence, ... is a tool to do this for you.
<pre>git_user=$USER # or whatever it is for you
repo=${git_user}-dots # This is the ... custom, though 'config' is more common
cd # currently ... only works in $HOME
git clone https://gitub.com/ingydotnet/...
conf=~/.../conf
echo install_method: symlink &gt; $conf # my pref, tho ingy prefers hardlinks
echo dot_paths: &gt; $conf
echo "- repo: https://github.com/$git_user/$repo" &gt; $conf
... upgrade</pre>
After that command runs, it should download that repo to ~/.../src/[reponame] and symlink any `bin/` contents to `~/bin` and any dotfiles to $HOME
<h2>Checkpoint 2 - Buddy Mode</h2>
One use case we considered at every stage of ... design/implementation was pair
programming. Here's an examlpe of adding a guest config:
<pre>echo '- repo: https://github.com/homebro/config' &gt;&gt; ~/.../conf
... upgrade</pre>
That's pretty much it!
Note that these have a specific set of rules for "merging" the symlinks: Whichever repo is first in the list
<h2>Checkpoint 3 - Private Repos</h2>
<pre>Code: TODO</pre>
Just because it is easy to use public repos does not mean that everything must be public.
Simply add a URL for a host that only you can reach
<pre>ssh otherhost git init --bare
# TODO</pre>
<h2>Checkpoint 4 - Sharpsaw Setup</h2>
Full on social configuration
Key ideas include
<ul>
  <li>organizing repos according to reasonable boundaries.</li>
  <li>aggressive and conservative configuration, mixed and matched</li>
  <li>concensus and exploration</li>
  <li>Constant improvement</li>
</ul>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mention ...@</li>
  <li>Mention ...each</li>
  <li>Time to update vs super_upgrade_install</li>
  <li>IRC channel - irc.freenode.net/#sharpsaw</li>
</ul>
